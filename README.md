# Controller Cursor

Moving the [Controller Slide Presenter](https://github.com/GerardGascon/Controller-Slide-Presenter) Project a step further, this one implements it inside a Godot project and uses it to render a Wii pointer when you press **Y** on the JoyCon.

## TODO

- [ ] Make the entire window click-through
- [ ] Add support to other platforms
